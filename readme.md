Battle Dungeon
--------------

Battle Dungeon is a fork of Battle Arena, which adds a variets of features to the game. The feature after which the mod is named isn't in yet.
The following changes have been made:

* The bot now waits a few seconds before joining the channel, to allow time for services to accept it.
* The damage amount is shown in purple if the target is resistant to the attack, or orange if the target is weak to the attack.
* Monsters' attribute scaling as the battle level is more dependent on their initial attributes.
* Fleeing the battle results in a draw instead of defeat, but has a chance to fail.
* The scoreboard HTML page is now HTML5 compliant. Also, a JSON scoreboard is now generated as well.
* Support for DCC sessions in IRC mode has been added. Enter `!dcc` to start a DCC CHAT session with the bot, which will bypass flood limits. Of course, only private transactions can take place there if the bot isn't in DCC mode.
* A few typos have been fixed.
* A new Allied NPC, the Tsarevna Alena from _Dragon Quest IV_, has been added.
* A new skill, Warp, has been added. It allows the user to sacrifice red orbs to select the field on which the next battle will take place.
* New achievements have been added:
  * Just Getting Started, for defeating the level 10 boss.
  * A Light in the Dark, for releasing a lost soul.
  * On the Edge, for surviving a battle with 2 % health or less.
  * The Legendary Overpowered Fighter, for encountering him.
