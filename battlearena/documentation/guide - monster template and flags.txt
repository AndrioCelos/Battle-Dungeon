[Info] Flags/Settings

Note that for many of these settings you will need to uncomment them in order for them to work (i.e. remove the ; at the start of the setting).

CanStagger=
StaggerAmount=
Stagger is the ability for the monster to be staggered (skip a turn) after being hurt for a certain # of damage. Set this to yes if you want it to be turned on. The StaggerAmount amount can be a static amount (such as 100) or can be a random amount by using $rand(#,#) (such as $rand(1,100)

RageMode=
If RageMode is set to Ignore and is uncommented, the monster will not gain a boost when Darkness hits the battlefield.

IgnoreQuicksilver=
If set to true the monster will not be affected by the Quicksilver style command.

ai_type=
This affects the AI type of monsters. Leave blank for normal monsters. Other valid types are: defender, berserker, PayToAttack, portal, healer

* DEFENDER
This AI type will do nothing but defend each round (think Orb Fountain or Lost Soul)

* BERSERKER
This AI type will attack anyone on the battlefield, even his/her/its own allies.

* PAYTOATTACK
This AI type will not take action in battle unless it has been paid (given red orbs). This AI type only works on NPCs as monsters cannot give items to another monster.

* PORTAL
This AI type will summon other monsters on its round.

* HEALER
This AI type will only use healing techniques on its allies each round.

Streak=
This setting is for the minimum streak # it takes for the monster to show up. Leave blank if you want the monster to show up at any streak #.

StreakMax=
This setting is for the maximum streak # that the monster can show up on. Leave blank if you want the monster to never have a cap on when it can show up.

CanFlee=
Do you want the monster to be able to flee from the battle? Set true if you do, else leave it false.

CanUseItems=
True or false. If set to true, this monster can use battle items (found in items_battle.lst) if those items are listed in their [item_amount]. False by default.

SpawnAfterDeath=
If set to a monster's file name, that monster or boss will be summoned when this monster is killed.

CanTaunt=
Can the monster taunt its opponent? Assumed to be true if blank, often set to true by default. Set to false if you don't want the monster to taunt.

Guardian=

JustReleaseDefense=
This setting is how much resistance to the skill “Just Release” the monster has. The number is a percent of the damage blocked. 0 = no block, 100 = 100% blocked. If left blank the monster will automatically have 0.

Valid conditions are: melee, magic, tech, item, renkei, status, magiceffect - You can list multiple by putting a period inbetween such as: melee.magic.status If the monster is killed by something that isn't the death condition, it'll be revived until killed with the condition.
