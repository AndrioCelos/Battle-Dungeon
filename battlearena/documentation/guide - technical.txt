TECHNICAL ASPECTS
This guide will be more about the technical aspects including why I did things the way I did and going into detail about some of the dat files.


SYSTEM.DAT
The system.dat controls and stores some information for running the bot. In this section I'll break it down.

If you open the system.dat you'll see the following sections: [botinfo] [system] [statprices] [style] and [version].
[botinfo]

This section keeps the bot owner (person who has access to a few more commands than normal players), the channel the bot sits in and displays all the messages to, the name of the bot, and the bot's password that it sends to nickserv upon connecting. All of this information should be generated the first time you run the bot.

Note, you can have multiple bot owners in version 1.2 and beyond. To do so add them like such:

bot.owner=name.name.name.name

In other words, a name followed by a period, another name. Don't add a period to the end of the last name.
[system]

This section controls a lot of the in-game functions and limits such as, but not limited to, base # of orbs for normal monsters and bosses, how many orbs players start with, the name of the currency and the time between battles in minutes.

botType=
IRC, DCCchat or TWITCH. This tells the bot where to display messages and accept commands. If you have a lot of players and don't want limits on the # of monsters that can appear in battles, use DCCchat mode* (your players will need a client that can do DCC Chat connections). If you are trying to run the bot on Twitch (which is not recommended) set this to TWITCH mode which slows the speed of output down and makes everything output to the channel (no private messages). IRC mode is default and is the most recommended mode for most people/bot owners.

AllowColors=
true or false. If set to false then all colors will be stripped from the messages that are output to the players. Set to true by default.

AllowBold=
true or false. If set to false then all bold will be stripped from the messages that are output to the players. Set to true by default.

automatedbattlesystem=
on or off. If you want to turn the automated battle system off you can change that here.

automatedaibattlecasino=
on or off. Off by default. If set to on, the bot will only do 1vs1 AI battles and players will be unable to participate.

showCustomBattleMessages=
true or false. If set to true it'll show the new battle starting messages for orb fountains and bosses. If set to false it'll show the old one.

aisystem=
on or off. If you want to turn off the AI for monsters you can change that here. Note that in order for the 1vs1 AI Battles to work properly this needs to be set to on.

basexp=
how many orbs are normal monsters worth upon defeating? This value is the base amount (before style and other factors are calculated).

basebossxp=
same as basexp except for bosses. This only affects red orbs.

startingorbs=
How many orbs should players start with? This value is the base amount before the average shop level is multiplied to the base.

currency=
If you don't want players to accumulate “red orbs” you can change it to whatever you want. Note, you can't change “black orbs”, only the red. For example, you can change this to “exp” or “coins” or “sheep skins” and it'll still work.

BetCurrency=
$$ by default, this option is the symbol for the betting currency.

TimeBetweenBattles=
This is the time, in minutes, between after a battle ends to when it starts. This doesn't affect the time that the entry time is open for, just the time it takes inbetween. (i.e. the “a battle will begin in X minutes”)

TimeForIdle=
How long should players have for a turn before it skips to the next person? The default is 180 seconds. The time you put here has to be in seconds.

TimeToEnter=
How long should the open period for a battle be? This is the time period that players can use !enter to enter the battle. The time here has to be put in seconds. The default is 120 seconds.

TimeBetweenSave=
How long should players have to wait in between each !save battle streak command? Default is 3600 seconds (or 1 hour). The time here must be in seconds.

maxHP=
the max amount of HP players can have. By default it's 2500.

EnableDoppelganger=
if you want the doppelganger boss fights to be enabled or not. Put true or false. It's set to true by default.

EnableWarMachine=
if you want the war machine boss fights to be enabled or not. Put true or false. It's set to true by default.

EnableBandits=
true or false, true by default. This toggles the bandit boss type on and off.

true or false, true by default. This toggles the pirate boss type on and off.

EnableCrystalShadow=
true or false, true by default. This toggles the crystal shadow warrior boss type on and off.

EnableGremlins=
true or false, true by default. This toggles the Gremlin special boss type on and off.

AllowDemonwall=
yes/no If you want the demon wall boss battles to exist at ranges 300-600, put this as yes. It's set to yes by default.

AllowWallOfFlesh=
yes/no If you want the Wall of Flesh boss battles to exist, put this as yes. It's set to yes by default.

EnablePresidentKidnapping=
true or false. By default it's set to true. If you want the kidnapped president event to occur, leave it as true or set it to false to turn it off.

EnableChests=
If you want chests and keys to drop. Put true or false. It's set to true by default. If set to false, neither keys nor chests will drop.

MaxCharacters=
How many characters should each player be allowed to have? The default is 2.

true or false. If set to true the !orbs command will display the results in the channel. If set to false, the !orbs command will display in a private message to the person who uses the command. If you have a lot of players in your channel it might be advisable to set this to false.

ShowDiscountMessage=
true or false. False by default. If set to true, an item description will be shown when players use the Discount Card type items. If set to false it will not show the descriptions.

BattleDamageFormula=
1, 2 or 3. There's three damage formulas in the bot currently. Damage Formula #3 is set by default since it's the newest and most balanced, but you can change it to whichever one you want to use. If you are using an older copy of a system.dat you may need to change it manually to 3 if you want to be using the most current battle damage formulas.

EnableBattlefieldEvents=
true/false If you want the random battlefield events to happen, set this to true. It's true by default.

GuaranteedBossBattles=
these are a list of battles which guarantee a boss to show up. There's a bunch set by default and you can go in and change them if you want. Just remember to separate the numbers with a period inbetween (like 10.20.30.40, etc).

IgnoreDmgCap=
true/false. If set to true, it will remove most of the damage caps that are in place in the bot (but does not ignore damage cap from reflect and counters).

MaxNumberOfMonsInBattle=
You can set this to whatever number you want but the default is 6. Keep in mind that 99.999% of IRC servers have flood control and if set too high it will cause the bot to flood out if an AOE happens on monsters.

BonusEvent=
true or false. If set to true then the orb orbs rewarded at the end of battle will be doubled (even during a loss).

ChestTime=
How long a chest stays in the game before it fades away/gets destroyed. Default is 45 seconds

RedChestBase=
The base amount of red orbs that are inside of red chests. The default is $rand(150,700). You can adjust the amounts inside of the $rand if you want a random amount or you can put a static amount (like =1000). Keep in mind that this value is multiplied and increased on higher streak levels.

MaxDemonWallTurns=
10 by default. This is how many turns players have to defeat the demon wall before the battle ends with them being crushed.

MimicChance=
10 by default (10%). What chance a chest has in becoming a mimic.

PhantomBetters=
how many fake betters will participate in 1vs1 AI Battles to help generate the odds. This can't be set lower than 3. Setting it too high will cause lag on slower machines.

EnableAuctionHouse=
true or false. If set to true, the auction house will be on and will generate items for players to bid on. If set to false then no players can bid. This is set to true by default.

BattleThrottle=
true or false, set to false by default. If set to true players will have to wait a round out before entering the next battle after the battle they're in ends.

LimitPortalBattles=
true or false. If set to true players can only use 8 portal items a day, which then resets at midnight (bot's time). This is set to true by default.

GenerateHTML=
true or false. If set to true the bot will generate an HTML file when !scoreboard is used. This is set to true by default.

PlayersMustDieMode=
true or false. This will turn the Players Must Die mode on or off. While on, monsters are harder and players won't get their HP and TP restored at the end of each battle.

WheelGameCost=
This is the cost in red orbs it takes to play the Wheel minigame once the wheel merchant has been saved. It's set to 500 by default.

WheelGameTime=
This is the time the players must wait before they can spin again after playing. Default is 43200 seconds (12 hours). The time here must be in seconds.

TwitchDelayTime=
This is how fast messages are output in TWITCH mode. By default it's set to 2. If the bot is being kicked a lot by Twitch try increasing this.

ShowDeleteEcho=
If set to true this setting will cause the bot to echo a line showing every time a .char file is erased. Useful for debugging if something is going amiss. False by default.
[statprices]

mnd=250
agi=250
spd=250
ig=800
[style]

This section is for how many base style points a player gets for killing either a boss or a normal monster. Note that just because the default value is 80 for bosses and 60 for monsters it doesn't mean that's exactly how many a player will get (there's other factors for calculating the resulting style points). Defaults are listed below.

BossDeath=80
MonDeath=60
[Mech]

This section contains controls for mechs.

EnergyCostConstant=

[auctionInfo]

This section controls the Auction House. It will be automatically generated and updated if the auction house is enabled.
[version]

This section is used to store the current system.dat version. If your version doesn't match what the version is expected by the bot, the bot will check through your system.dat and add the new sections as necessary. Don't mess with this manually, even if you think you have the latest version.




BATTLESTATS.DAT
The battlestats.dat, at the moment, keeps track of the total number of battles the bot has had, how many wins/losses, and the current winning or losing streak; as well as dragon ball information, conquest information, and AI Battle information.
[battle]

This section contains information on all the battles that the bot has had since it has started. In here you can see the total number of battles, how many wins, how many losses, how many draws, the current winning or losing streak, the level adjust (which makes battles harder), the gauntlet record, how many empty rounds have occured, how many “game days” have passed, and how many Allied Forces Presidents have been captured/rescued/killed.

This section can be completely cleared by using a bot admin command.
[conquest]

The conquest section contains information on the Conquest system. In here you can see when the last tally was, how many conquest points the players have (negative means monsters are winning), how many orbs players are receiving as a bonus (if they've won the conquest period), who the previous winner was, as well as how many times players and monsters have won.
[dragonballs]

This section contains information on the dragonballs including how many have been found, if they're active or if Shenron's Wish is current (and, if it is, what round it's on).
[AIBattles]

This section contains information on the AI vs AI Battles including how many total AI battles have occurred and how many times npcs and monsters have won each.




SHOPNPCS.DAT
shopnpcs.dat deals with the shop npc information.
[NPCStatus]

This section tells the bot if the NPC is either in the allied forces base, kidnapped, or not found yet. =false means not found, =true means in the base, and =kidnapped means the npc is kidnapped.

Santa=false
EasterBunny=false
DiscountCardMerchant=false
HealingMerchant=false
BattleMerchant=false
AlliedForcesPresident=true
ShieldMerchant=false
WheelMaster=kidnapped
TravelMerchant=false
Gardener=kidnapped
PotionWitch=false
[Events]

This is used for certain NPCs.

FrostLegionDefeated=false
SavedElves=0
[NPCNames]

This controls the names of the NPCs. If you don't like the ones I've picked feel free to edit this section to your liking.

Santa=Santa
EasterBunny=Easter Bunny
DiscountCardMerchant=Myles the Discount Merchant
HealingMerchant=Katelyn the Healing Merchant
BattleMerchant=Gerhardt the Battle Merchant
AlliedForcesPresident=Allied Forces President
ShieldMerchant=Gondo the Shield Merchant
WheelMaster=Dodoh the Wheel Master
TravelMerchant=Beedle the Traveling Merchant
Gardener=Green Thumb the Garden Moogle
PotionWitch=Syrup the Potion Witch
[AlliedForcesHQ]

This section is currently unused but may be used in a future update.

HQStrength=0
HQOrbsDonated=0
PresidentGuards=0



GARDEN.DAT

Garden.dat is used to store information on the Allied Forces HQ Garden minigame.
[GardenStats]

This section contains the XP, level, bonus and last checked information for the garden.

XP=
Level=1
LastChecked=
Bonus=0
[Seeds]

This section stores how many seeds have been planted by the players, how many of those seeds have become saplings and how many saplings have become trees.

Planted=0
Saplings=0
Trees=0
[Plants]

This section stores how many flowers have been planted by the players and how many have bloomed.

Planted=0
Bloomed=0



BATTLEFIELDS.DB
Battlefields.db controls the various battlefields that are available in the bot, the weather information and the “Time of Day” for the game. If you open the file up in notepad you'll see the weather information at the top.
[weather]

This section controls the weather.

current=calm
list=calm.bright.gloomy.rainy.stormy.snowy.windy.hot.dry
boost=.25

The .25 means that magic cast on the right day will give a 25% boost to the damage.
[MoonPhase]

The moon phases are controlled in this file as well. Please do not remove or modify the Moon Phase section as it will cause errors.

CurrentMoonPhase=Quarter
CurrentMoonTurn=4
[MoonPhaseTime]

This section controls how long each moon phase turn lasts (in number of battles). You can modify this section if you wish certain moon phases to last longer.

full=3
new=1
gibbous=5
quarter=4
crescent=2
blood=1
BloodMoonChance=60
[TimeOfDay]

This section keeps track of what time of day it is (in-game).

CurrentTimeOfDay=Morning
CurrentTimeOfDayTurn=1
[TimeOfDayTime]

This section controls how long (in number of battles) the times of day last before they switch to the next one.

morning=2
noon=2
evening=2
night=2
[Battlefields]

Battlefields are where the players face the monsters. The battlefields themselves control what kinds of weather are available and may have events that occasionally happen. There can be more than one event set per battlefield.

Here is a basic template you can use for making a new battlefield:

[template]
weather=calm.bright.gloomy.rainy.stormy.snowy.windy.hot.dry
NumberOfEvents=0
scavenge=
limitations=

event1=damage
event1Chance=20
Event1Desc=%real.name trips and falls Ow!
Event1Target=random
event1Amount=$rand(50,100) 

weather=
This is the section where you list what weather is available for that battlefield. The bot will choose randomly from this list.
Valid Weather: 	calm, bright, gloomy, rainy, stormy, snowy, windy, hot, dry

NumberOfEvents=
This tells the bot how many random battlefield events you have defined in the battlefield. Leave at 0 if you don't want the battlefield to have any.

scavenge=
This is a list of items that players can potentially find while using the !scavenge skill. You can list any item that's in the game and can list multiple by splitting it with periods between them (such as: potion.diamond.tonic)

limitations=
These are battlefield limitations. If set, players/monsters/npcs will lose access to certain commands or will be enhanced.
Valid Limitations: 	no-tech, no-item, no-skill, no-ignition, enhance-item, enhance-melee, enhance-tech no-mech

Making a Battlefield Event If you have listed a number in NumberOfEvents= you will need to now create your events. The format looks like this:

event#=
event#Chance=
Event#Desc=
Event#Target=
event#Amount=

Change the # to the current number of event. You will need those five lines for every event you have listed (so if you have 3 events you will need event1= event2= event3=, event1Chance=, event2Chance=, event3Chance=, etc)

event#=
This is where you define what type of event it is.
Valid Event Types: 	damage, heal, statusonly

* Note for statusonly you will need an extra line: event#statusType=statustypehere

event#Chance=
This defines how often the event will trigger. It can be 1-100 with 100 being it always happens at the end of everyone's turn.

Event#Desc=
What happens during the event. Use %real.name to show the name of the person affected.

Event#Target=
Here you tell the bot who is affected by this event.
Valid Targets: 	all, random, monsters, players *

* note that “players” as a target also affects NPCs

event#Amount=
How much damage does this event do? You can list a static amount or you can use $rand(#,#) to make it be varied.

Finally, for battlefields, it is possible to make a battlefield that does not show up during normal rotation (such as a special portal battle battlefield). If you want the bot to be able to select it for battles, make sure you put the name of it into battlefields.lst



.LST FILES
.lst files are “list” files. These files are used when the bot generates lists of things (such as a list of ignitions that players have, or a list of items they carry). These files should not be erased. If you end up making any new items, armor, or whatever you will need to add the name of whatever you make into the appropriate .lst file for it to show up in the bot.

Here is a list of the various list files found within the bot.

accessorytypes.lst
achievements.lst

DETAILED LOOK AT NEW_CHR.CHAR
In this section we'll take a look at the blank new character template file in detail so that you'll know what everything means. All .chr files can be opened in regular ol notepad as they don't contain anything special and are just plain text ini files.
[BaseStats]

This section is the “resting” stats that new characters start with. Resting stats are the stats the bot will reset the character to after each battle.

Hp=150
Tp=20
Str=5
Def=5
Int=5
Spd=5
Name= This is really more for monsters, bosses and npcs, but the name of the character is stored here.
[Battle]

These are the stats that are read for battles. These can be manipulated (using an ignition is an example of how these stats can be increased in battle). They'll be reset at the end of battle with the basestats.

Hp=150
Tp=20
Str=5
Def=5
Int=5
Spd=5
Status=alive
[Rage]

This section was actually used in my other bot, Kaiou, but I've kept it in this bot just in case I want to add in a rage system in the future. As of now though, there's no use for it.

RageBar=0
RageCountDown=0
[Descriptions]

This section is where descriptions are stored. Again, the “rage=” description is not used at the moment.

Char=This is the character description.
Rage=Not used
[Stuff]

As generic as this section is named, this holds the information for all the orbs collected, how many orbs have been spent, and the total number of deaths the character has endured (among other stats).

[Techniques]

This section keeps track of the technique levels that the player has. All starting characters start with level 1 DoublePunch.
