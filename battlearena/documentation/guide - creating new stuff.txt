GUIDE TO MAKING NEW MONSTERS/BOSSES/WEAPONS/TECHNIQUES

This guide is dedicated to those who want to learn how to make new monsters, new weapons and new techniques.  I don't include skills in this list because it requires a bit more coding to make happen (in-bot coding) whereas anyone can learn how to make the other things. It make seem complicated at first but after you do a few of them you'll get the hang of it and it'll be no sweat.




HOW TO CREATE A NEW WEAPON

The first step in creating a new weapon is to figure out what you want to name the weapon. It has to be a weapon name that doesn't already exist. So open weapons.db with notepad and do a quick search for the name of the weapon you've picked out. If it doesn't exist, keep going. If not, come up with a new name.

Second step is to add the weapon to the correct list. In weapons.db you should see several lines at the top of the file. They're split by weapon types and then the monster/npc section. If you're creating a weapon for players to purchase, add it to the correct weapon type. If you're making one for npcs or monsters, add it to the last MonsterWpns line (currently MonsterWpns6). Either way, find the correct line, add a period followed by the name of the weapon (for example .TestWeapon)

Now you're ready to add the actual weapon.

Scroll to the very bottom of the database file.

You can find an empty template and an explanation of each of the various settings inside of the weapon (see guide - weapon templates and flags.txt).

For the sake of a tutorial, let's create a weapon for a monster called “MonsterWeapon”:

[MonsterWeapon]
Cost=0
Type=HandToHand
Info=A monster's weapon, players can't buy it.
Abilities=MonsterTech1.MonsterTech2
Element=fire
Hits=$rand(1,2)
Basepower=10
Upgrade=0
IgnoreDefense=0
HurtEthereal=false
Energy=0
CanShieldReflect=false
CanCounter=true

And there you go. You've now successfully added a new weapon.


HOW TO CREATE A NEW TECHNIQUE

In this section you will learn how to create a technique for a weapon that players, monsters, npcs and bosses can use. As a note, it is possible to have new weapons use old techniques or old weapons to use new techniques. You just have to adjust it in the weapon's Abilities=

The first step to creating a new technique is to open techniques.db with notepad. You should notice that all the weapons are listed as name=techs. If you've just created a new weapon and want to add techniques to it you will need to add the weapon name to the list followed by = and a list of techniques that the weapon has (such as MonsterTestWeapon=MonsterTech1.MonsterTech2)

The next step is to create the actual techniques. Let's create two techniques for the monster weapon that was an example in the how to create a new weapon section. So let's scroll to the bottom of the file as it's easier to put all the new monster techniques at the bottom. If you were making techniques for players, I would put them in the category they belong to (like new sword techniques in the SWORDS section I have split out).

You can find a technique template and an explanation of all the various settings by reading guide - tech template and flags.txt

For the sake of this tutorial, we have two techs to make. Let's make one be a status type that inflicts Paralysis and then make the other be an AOE that hits all players on the battlefield when used. Let's also assume the AOE is fire magic based but the paralysis is non-magic.

[MonsterTech1]
Type=Single
StatusType=paralysis
TP=10
Desc=jumps at %enemy and injects a paralyzing venom to cause paralysis.
BasePower=10
Magic=No
Element=None
Cost=0

[MonsterTech2]
Type=AOE
TP=10
Desc=engulfs the battlefield with a powerful flame that causes fire damage to all targets
BasePower=10
Magic=Yes
Element=Fire
Cost=0

And there we go. Our two techs are now done and added into techniques.db. Hit save and you're done with that.

If you're ever confused about any of this, you can always scroll through and look at some of the pre-made techniques to know how it all works.



CREATING NEW MONSTERS
We've made the new weapon and the two techniques that go onto that weapon, now we need to make the monster that will use these to fight our players. Let's assume the monster is named testmonster to go along with the rest of our test theme.

First things first, navigate to the \monsters\to make folder. Inside you should see new_mon.char. Make a quick copy of it and rename the copy to testmonster.char. Now open that file with notepad.

You'll see most of the work is already done for you, but the starting monsters are a bit weak so let's adjust this a little bit.

Under [basestats] you'll see this:
Name=

Put the monster's name there. You can leave out the underscores, dashes, and whatnot. For our example we can put it as:

Name=Test Monster

The Name field is used whenever the monster does something in battle and when the monster is summoned.

Edit the stats to however you feel fit. Just keep in mind that the stats are multiplied a certain value when the monster is summoned into battle (the value is based on how many players are in battle and how many times the players have won or lost in a row). So don't set the stats too high or else you'll find that your monster is immortal and will slaughter everything with ease (unless that's what you want, then go ahead I guess).

For me I'll change the stats to this:

Hp=45
Tp=30
Str=12
Def=5
Int=5
Spd=7

Next scroll down to [descriptions] and you'll see this: Char=set a character desc here that appears when the monster is summoned.

You need to change it. The bot will automatically add the monster's name to the description, so don't start the description off with that. Here's what I'll put:

Char=is a testing monster used for an example in the tutorial. It's fearsome. Roar.

Monsters can have a type, if you scroll down to [monster] you'll see the type= line. However, the only real valid types right now are Undead and Zombie. If your monster isn't one of those, just leave it blank for now. I'm going to leave it blank.

Scroll down to [weapons] and now you need to add the weapon you made above before creating the monster. In this case, I'm doing the MonsterTestWeapon. You need to add it to the equipped line but also make a line with the name of the weapon= a number, where the number is the level that the monster has in that weapon. This affects damage output.

[Weapons]
Equipped=MonsterTestWeapon
MonsterTestWeapon=10

Now we add the techs we made. Again, here the # is the base skill that the monster has in that tech (affects damage).

[Techniques]
MonsterTech1=5
MonsterTech2=10

And that's basically it. There are a few other things you can do with monsters that I'll explain below, but for all intents and purposes, after you do the above steps, the monster is ready for use. You can move the .char file into the main \monsters\ folder and it'll eventually be summoned by the bot (at random).

Here's a few other things you can change:

Elemental Weaknesses/Strengths:

If you want your monster to be weak to certain elements, or you want them to be resistant to them, you can scroll down to the [Modifiers] section and adjust the values there Remember that the values are in percents with 100 being normal, 100% damage from it. Setting something over 100 means they take more damage from it and setting it under 100 means they take less damage from it (with 0 being immune/no damage at all from it). For the heal= line you can set multiple elements by putting a period inbetween them, such as heal=fire.earth

Skills:
Scroll to [Skills] and list them as Skill=# Here's just a few examples:

[Skills]
DesperateBlows=1

Clearmind=1

ManaWall=1
manawall.on=on

Wizardry=10

Swordmaster=5

royalguard=1
royalguard.on=on

And that's how you make your monsters!



CREATING NEW NPCS
You make NPCs the same as you do monsters. Open new_npc.char in \npcs\to make\ and copy/rename/edit it like you would with a monster. When you're done, move the file into the \npcs\ folder for it to randomly show up in battle.


CREATING NEW BOSSES
Again, making bosses is pretty much the same as making new monsters. Go to \bosses\to make\ and copy/rename/edit the file you copy. There's only two major differences between bosses and monsters.

First, in [Descriptions] bosses have a BossQuote= line that they say upon being summoned into battle. You can change this to whatever, but keep in mind the bot will add the “ ” around whatever you put in this line.

Second, for drops, you will need to put them in the drops.db file.

For example, BossName=Potion, where BossName is replaced by the actual Boss name.

This is the item that the boss will drop to the most stylish player upon defeat. You can set this to any item that exists in items.db, whether it be a healing item, a battle item, or a food (stat) item.
